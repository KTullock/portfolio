# Kaila's Portfolio

## Description

This project serves to provide me with a portfilio to show potential employers during the hiring process after I complete the coding boot camp. In the portfolio, I provided a brief paragraph about me, links to my work thus far in the boot camp, and my contact information. During the process of building my portfolio, I learned the importance of using flex properties and media queries. I also learned how to link my projects to my portfolio via buttons.
